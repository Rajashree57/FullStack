        <p><strong>1.Radio Button Not a Group </strong><br/> <br/>
            Practically radio buttons are used in group.
            So that when one button is selected then the other already get unselected if it was previously selected.
            In a group of radio buttons, all the radio elements are connected.<br/>
            Only one button can be selected at a time. 
            Here is an example where radio buttons are not part of a group.</p> 

        <!-- Not a group ❌-->
        <input type="radio"> Email 
        <input type="radio"> Phone
        <input type="radio"> Mail 
        
        <p><strong>2.HTML Radio Group </strong> <br/> <br/>
            Radio buttons in the above example are not part of any group.
            A radio group is defined by the name attribute. 
            When 2 or more radio buttons are in a group they have the same name attribute.
            When multiple radio buttons are given the same name then it becomes part of a group and when you select any radio button of that group it automatically deselects any other selected button in that group.
        
        

        <!-- Group ✅ -->
        <p><strong> Please select your preferred way to contact </strong></p> <br/>
        <input type="radio" name="contact"> Email
        <input type="radio" name="contact"> Phone
        <input type="radio" name="contact"> Message <br/> <br/>

        <p><strong><b>3.Radio Button Value</b></strong> <br/> <br/>
            All radio buttons shown above have no value. <br/> <br/>
            This means if you select one then they don't know for what value you want to select it.
            Just an option written in front of it doesn't mean it will take it as input.
            To specify value for radio button give it a value attribute. <br/> <br/>

            <!-- Example <input type="radio" value="email" -->

            <!-- Radio button with value -->
        <input type="radio" name="contact" value="email"> Email
        <input type="radio" name="contact" value="phone"> Phone
        <input type="radio" name="contact" value="message"> Message

        </p>
